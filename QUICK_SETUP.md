# ðŸš€ Quick Setup Guide

## Step 1: Get Your Supabase Credentials

1. Go to [Supabase Dashboard](https://supabase.com/dashboard)
2. Select your project (or create a new one)
3. Go to **Settings** â†’ **API**
4. Copy these values:
   - **Project URL** (looks like: `https://your-project.supabase.co`)
   - **Service Role Key** (long string starting with `eyJ...`)

## Step 2: Create Environment File

Create a file named `.env.local` in the `clinic-management` directory with this content:

```env
NEXT_PUBLIC_SUPABASE_URL=https://your-project.supabase.co
SUPABASE_SERVICE_ROLE_KEY=eyJ...your-service-role-key
JWT_SECRET=your-secret-key-change-this
```

## Step 3: Run Setup Script

```bash
node scripts/complete-setup.js
```

This will:
- âœ… Create the environment file
- âœ… Install dependencies
- âœ… Apply database schema
- âœ… Add sample data
- âœ… Test the connection

## Step 4: Start the Application

```bash
npm run dev
```

Open http://localhost:3000 and login with:
